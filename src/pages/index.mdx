  <NumberPoints title="We do three main things">
    1. ### Microgrants
        We run a microgrant program to fund explorers across the world to work on quantum technologies. Do you have an idea for a project?
        
        [Apply for a microgrant.](https://unitaryfund.typeform.com/to/j0kAOd?typeform-source=unitary.fund)<br />
        See our [FAQ](/faqs) and [previous grants](/grants).

    2.  ### Research
        We do our own research to help the ecosystem as a whole. For example, we are developing [(1)mitiq](/research/mitiq), an open source compiler for error-mitigated quantum programming, and **[(2)metriq](/research/metriq), an open community platform for sharing quantum tech benchmarks.

    3.  ### Community
        We host an open source quantum tech community that runs [hackathons](https://unitaryhack.dev) and events on our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/JqVGmpkP96). Have a look at our [Calendar.](community/events)

    **Project could be open source quantum sofware, education materials and workshops, a new quantum sensor prototype, or much more.**

    Our program is designed to be as simple as possible. No organizational affiliation required. **Just a short form and a two minute video.**

        I imagine that years from now, some of the biggest contributors in quantum computing will
        have come through the Unitary Fund program. The grants provide avenues for creative,
        motivated folks to meaningfully contribute to this new industry. Awardees are using the
        program to launch their careers in quantum computing, landing jobs at Zapata and elsewhere.

        Our support of the Unitary Fund enables continued growth of the quantum computing ecosystem.
        It is an opportunity to connect with and help quantum developers from a diverse range of
        skill sets and backgrounds.
