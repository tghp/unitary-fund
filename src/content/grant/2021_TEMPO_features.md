To [Gerald E. Fux](https://twitter.com/fuxgerald) and Dominic Gribben and the [TEMPO collaboration](https://github.com/tempoCollaboration/TimeEvolvingMPO) to develop an open source python package for simulating non-Markovian open quantum systems using tensor network techniques. In particular, the grant will enable adding two new features: studying the role of environment correlation functions through observables of the system and of multiple environments coupled to a single system.
