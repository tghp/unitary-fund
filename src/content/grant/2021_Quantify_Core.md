To the teams at Orange Quantum Systems and Qblox, to develop [Quantify Core](https://quantify-quantify-core.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/stable/), an open-source Python-based data acquisition and experiment control platform for quantum computing and solid-state physics experiments. It is built on [QCoDeS](https://qcodes.github.io/Qcodes/) and is a spiritual successor of [PycQED](https://github.com/DiCarloLab-Delft/PycQED_py3).
