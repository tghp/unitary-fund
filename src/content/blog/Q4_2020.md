To the Unitary Fund community,

Last year we ended the year by awarding 20 micro-grants, of which five in Q4. We’re proud of the impact the program is making. You can read more about our milestones and activities in the 2020 [Annual Report](https://unitary.fund/assets/Unitary_Fund_2020_Report.pdf). We have lots of updates: We collaborated with the QOSF to inaugurate and award the Wittek Quantum Prize for open-source software, we inaugurated the Quantum Software Talks series on Twitch, and now there are more than 270 members on our [Discord server](http://discord.unitary.fund).

We’ve kept developing [Mitiq](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq), the quantum error mitigation toolkit in Python developed at Unitary Labs, now with six contributors from the quantum ecosystem.

We continue to work hard to support the development of a vibrant, open quantum technology ecosystem. Thanks to all of you who have joined us in this mission.

*   ****New from Unitary Fund****

*   **Help wanted:** We have put out an Administrator position job [post](https://unitary.fund/jobs/administrator.html): help us spread the word.
*   If you missed it, read our [2020 **Annual Report**](https://unitary.fund/posts/2020.html) here.
*   About **Mitiq**: 

*   We continue to develop the library, now at its 0.4.1 [release](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html) on PyPI. You can join our community call on Fridays at 2:30pm ET on Discord ( [discord.unitary.fund](http://discord.unitary.fund/))
*   Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KDQtWzJcfw) of Ryan LaRose’s talk on Mitiq, including ongoing work to implement probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) 

*   We painstakingly reviewed nominations from a great pool of candidates and [awarded](https://medium.com/qosf/announcing-the-winner-of-the-2020-wittek-quantum-prize-for-open-source-software-59e847b38d9b) the **Wittek Quantum Prize** for quantum open source software, in collaboration with QOSF. Congratulations to Roger Luo for winning, and for all the hard work they have put in to making the quantum open source ecosystem better! You can read the article from [TQD](https://thequantumdaily.com/2020/10/19/quantum-open-source-foundation-kicks-off-the-wittek-quantum-prize/) on the Prize announcement and [award](https://thequantumdaily.com/2021/02/02/announcing-the-winner-of-the-2020-wittek-quantum-prize-for-open-source-software/). 
*   We began streaming the [**Quantum Software Talks Series**](https://unitary.fund/talks.html) on Twitch, with recordings uploaded to Youtube. We hosted Daniel Strano (Qrack), Alex McCaskey (QCOR).
*   Read about [our collaboration with **Pasqal**](https://pasqal.io/2021/01/22/pulser-a-control-software-at-the-pulse-level-for-pasqal-quantum-processors/) on Pulser, a pulse-level control software library for atom-based quantum processors.

*   ****New Grants****

*   To the team at [Qubit By Qubit](https://www.qubitbyqubit.org/), to develop courses and materials to educate a diverse ecosystem of open source quantum contributors.
*   To Pedro Rivero Ramírez for [QRand](https://github.com/pedrorrivero/qrand/), a multi-platform quantum random number generator library integrated with numpy.
*   To [Jacob Miller](http://jemisjoky.com/) for a PyTorch toolbox for matrix product state models.
*   To [Rochisha Agarwal](https://rochisha0.github.io/) and [Natansh Mathur](https://www.linkedin.com/in/natanshmathur/) to create a Quantum Machine Learning Textbook with integrated code and visualization.
