Unitary Fund is pleased to announce [IBM Quantum](https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/) has granted special quantum computing access to the Unitary Fund community. Thanks to this partnership, recipients of a Unitary Fund [micro-grant](https://unitary.fund/) will receive the following benefits:

- A larger share of the queue on open IBM Quantum systems.
- Access to additional, non-open systems.
- The ability to book dedicated time on a system.

These benefits will spur further innovation in the quantum computing space, and directly enables Unitary Fund's mission of helping create a quantum technology ecosystem that benefits the most people. We are particularly pleased to be able to extend these benefits to the explorers in quantum technology who do not have a formal academic affiliation.

Moreover, through this partnership, our technical team at Unitary Labs will further benchmark [Mitiq](https://unitary.fund/mitiq.html), our open-source quantum error mitigating compiler, on real quantum hardware.

The Unitary Fund team would like to thank IBM Quantum for their support, in particular Sebastian Hassinger, IBM Quantum Research & Ecosystem Partnerships Lead.
