To the Unitary Fund community,

We are growing and evolving! **This quarter we launched [Mitiq](https://unitary.fund/mitiq.html) - the first open source project incubated at Unitary Labs - and funded six new projects ranging from new educational platforms to optimal quantum compilers and software for quantum RAMs.** We saw more micro-grant applications this quarter than ever before and are thrilled to see the interest in our program continue to grow.

We continue to work hard to support the development of a vibrant, open quantum technology ecosystem. Thanks to all of you who have joined us in this mission.

*   **New from Unitary Fund**
  

*   Two articles covering our work in The Quantum Daily. \[[short article](https://thequantumdaily.com/2020/07/29/non-profit-fund-working-to-create-innovative-qc-projects-with-grants/)\] \[[longer article](https://thequantumdaily.com/2020/08/13/tqd-exclusive-unitary-fund-team-pushes-for-an-open-qc-industry-that-benefits-the-most-people/)\]  
    
*   We [launched the first version of Mitiq](https://unitary.fund/posts/mitiq.html), our open source error mitigating compiler. \[[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04417)\] \[[github](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq)\] \[[video overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLJNDFtAmDk)\]
*   We spoke about Mitiq and Unitary Fund [at several venues](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/wiki/Mitiq-Talks-and-Events).
*   Our paper on Digital Zero Noise Extrapolation was accepted to [IEEE Quantum Week](https://qce.quantum.ieee.org/paper-tracks/).
*   With help from our supporters at [Strangeworks](https://strangeworks.com/) we upgraded our website: [https://unitary.fund/](https://unitary.fund/)
*   We launched our YouTube [channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDbDLAzGRTHnhkoMMOX7D1A).
*   [Peter Karalekas](https://github.com/karalekas) and [Sarah Kaiser](https://www.sckaiser.com/) joined the UF team!

*   **New Grants**
  

*   To [Olivia De Matteo](http://glassnotes.github.io/) and [Sarah Kaiser](https://www.sckaiser.com/) to build and optimize an open source Q# library for quantum RAM. \[[github](https://github.com/qsharp-community/qram)\]

*   To [Daniel Tan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6CORrpcAAAAJ&hl=en) to develop and open source the Optimal Layout Synthesizer for Quantum Computing, OLSQ. This compiler beats other benchmarks on optimal layout of computational qubits onto physical qubits. \[[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15671)\] \[ [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09783)\]
*   To [Spencer Churchill](https://github.com/splch) to write [Quantum Tales](https://github.com/splch/quantum-tales), short stories with code where quantum algorithms are applied to solve tasks.
*   To [Mark Cunningham](https://markcunningham.tech/) to explore applications of quantum computing to medical imaging.

*   **News from UF Projects**
  

*   The [NYCQuantum Meetup hosted talks](https://www.meetup.com/New-York-Quantum-Computing-Meetup/events/271943801) from several UF projects from around the globe.  
    
*   [YaoLang](https://yaoquantum.org/) released support for its first circuit optimization pass based on ZXcalculus with help from the other unitary fund project [PyZX](https://github.com/Quantomatic/pyzx).
*   QuNetSim released a new [video overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE6jWjW1WT8&feature=emb_title) on quantum network simulation
*   Toqito released a [new video overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R7qSszJwBI) along with new features for state distinguishability scenarios and tools to detect whether a given state is entangled or separable. More [details here](https://github.com/vprusso/toqito/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
*   Sarah Kaiser [spoke about the qRAM in q# project](https://www.meetup.com/Washington-Quantum-Computing-Meetup/events/271334520/)
