We believe that it is important to involve the research and technical communities to ensure the quantum open source ecosystem can scale. For this reason, Unitary Fund is co-organizing two workshops as part of International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QEC21), run by IEEE which is one of the largest professional societies in the world.  
  
The first workshop is on [**Quantum Intermediate Representations**](https://qce.quantum.ieee.org/workshops-program/#alexandermccaskey) ([mini-website](https://unitaryfund.github.io/quantum-intermediate-rep-workshop/)). This workshop explores approaches that let quantum language compilers target a common intermediate layer that can be further lowered to any native backend architecture. Common standards are required to reduce the proliferation of quantum computing system architectures and associated mechanisms for high-level programming, which place a burden on programmers hoping to write quantum-classical applications that target a variety of quantum backends. The workshop will be held on **Friday, Oct 22, 2021 Time: 10:45-16:45 Mountain Time (MDT)**.  
  
The second workshop is on [**Open Quantum Hardware**](https://qce.quantum.ieee.org/workshops-program/#nathanshammah). While open-sourcing “quantum software” is already established, this workshop focuses on the ongoing and upcoming development of the tools and components actually used to build quantum computers and make them accessible: From software for electronic design and analysis, to control systems and testbeds. The Workshop will occur on **Tuesday October 19th from 10:45 to 16:45 Mountain Time**.  

[Registration for IEEE Quantum Week](https://qce.quantum.ieee.org/registration/registration-overview/) is still open! You will find open-access material in Unitary Fund’s repository, such as on the Open Quantum Hardware [mini-website](https://unitaryfund.github.io/openquantumhardware-workshop/).

zs We would also like to highlight an in-depth tutorial at QCE21 from one of our collaborators called “Pulse-level Programming of Neutral-Atom Devices with Pulser”. This session is scheduled for Tuesday, Oct 19, 2021 at 10:45-14:30 MDT.
