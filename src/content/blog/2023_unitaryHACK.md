Unitary Fund is happy to announce the third edition of **[unitaryHACK](https://unitaryhack.dev/), which will run from May 26th to June 13th, 2023**.

unitaryHACK differs from the rest of the hackathon-style events in the quantum computing space because **hackers support existing quantum computing projects**.
In addition hackers get paid for their work while building professional skills such as working on open source projects, and contributing to create a more functional, and featured, quantum computing stack.
We want this event to show folks what amazing projects are out there, and help maintainers find new ways and contributors to continue to grow their projects.
Event logistics are detailed in our [hacker guide](https://unitaryhack.dev/hacker-guide/), and [rules for contributing](https://unitaryhack.dev/rules/) are available as well.
In order to collect your winings, you'll need to be signed up!
