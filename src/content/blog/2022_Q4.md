Dear Unitary Fund community,

We are excited to share our quarterly update and highlight some of what
UF's been involved with so far this year. We announced a new batch of
[Ambassadors](https://unitary.fund/posts/2022_ambassadors.html):
Alberto, Amir, Nick and Rahul!

We continue to grow the Mitiq project with a wide community (over 50
contributors!). We've uploaded two research preprints using Mitiq: for
[automated error mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08611)
and testing error mitigation with Mitiq
[out-of-the-box](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07194) on different
hardware -- improving results of NISQ devices.

New projects joined the Unitary Fund
[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/JqVGmpkP96): OpenQAOA and
Covalent.Check out their community calls that are hosted there.

We awarded our first grant ever to a project in Rust, for Quantum Error
Correction, to Lev Stambler! We've analyzed and discussed with the community in two open
Discord calls the insights from the [Quantum Open Source Software
Survey](https://unitary.fund/posts/2022_survey_results.html):

Thank you all for your continued support of the open-source quantum
ecosystem!

**New from UF**

-   **Mitiq**

    -   The [Mitiq whitepaper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04417)
        > was published in *Quantum **6**, 774 (2022)*

    -   New Releases:
        > [v0.20.0](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/releases/tag/v0.20.0),
        > [v0.21.0](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/releases/tag/v0.21.0),
        > [v0.22.0](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/releases/tag/v0.22.0)

        -   Version 0.20.0 focuses on updating our support for numpy
            > (1.23), adding a tutorial demonstrating the learning-based
            > PEC workflow, and scoping out what device/noise
            > calibration might look like as part of Mitiq. Additionally
            > identity insertion has been added as a noise-scaling
            > technique available for mitigation protocols such as
            > zero-noise extrapolation.

        -   Version 0.21.0 officially adds support for the
            > learning-based PEC sub-technique which is now [fully
            > documented](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/pec-3-options.html#applying-learning-based-pec)
            > and functions to apply Readout Error Mitigation (REM).

        -   Version 0.22.0 focused on improving the Mitiq documentation
            > with three new examples, new REM docs, and navigation
            > improvements, along with some bug fixes. This release also
            > adds a new module calibration which allows one to run a
            > series of experiments to see what error mitigation
            > parameters will work best for their particular setup.

        -   Read more in our updated
            > [Examples](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/examples.html)
            > section.

        -   Special thanks to the volunteering contributors:
            > \@purva-thakre and \@nickgardner \@amirebrahimi!
