We are glad to announce that last year Unitary Fund provided technical advisory to the Pasqal quantum software team, on their freshly released [Pulser](https://github.com/pasqal-io/Pulser) package, an open-source toolkit to emulate atom-based pulse-level quantum systems. Pulser is powered by and integrated with [QuTiP](http://qutip.org/) – and will soon provide pulse-level access to atom-based quantum processors from the cloud. You can read more about it in Pasqal’s [press release](https://pasqal.io/2021/01/22/pulser-a-control-software-at-the-pulse-level-for-pasqal-quantum-processors/).
