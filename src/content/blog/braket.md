The Mitiq development team is excited to announce that with the latest release of Mitiq, Amazon Braket is now supported as a back-end for running verbatim circuits. To demonstrate this, we collaborated with the Braket team to benchmark the performance of the Rigetti Aspen-9 device with and without Mitiqâ€™s zero-noise extrapolation on mirror circuits.  
  
Results from the benchmark and methodology are detailed on the [Amazon Braket blogpost](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/quantum-computing/exploring-quantum-error-mitigation-with-mitiq-and-amazon-braket/), and you can check out the sample code in the [Mitiq docs](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/braket_mirror_circuit.html).
