To the Unitary Fund community,

The quantum technology ecosystem continues to accelerate its growth with new investments [\[1\]](https://ionq.com/news/march-08-2021-ionq-to-become-first-public-quantum-computer-company/)[\[2\]](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/press/2021/06/honeywell-quantum-solutions-and-cambridge-quantum-computing-will-combine-to-form-worlds-largest-most-advanced-quantum-business) [\[3\]](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/xanadu-closes-100m-usd-series-b-to-build-a-fault-tolerant-photonic-quantum-computer-301298647.html) and advancing technology [\[4\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14734)[\[5\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15534)[\[6\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.16235). At [Unitary Fund](https://unitary.fund/) we’ve continued to grow our existing programs around [microgrants](https://unitary.fund/grants.html) and [mitiq](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq) and found exciting success with new experiments like [unitaryHack](https://unitaryfund.github.io/unitaryhack/). [Decentralized](https://opencollective.com/), [open](https://gitcoin.co/grants/) [communities](https://fundoss.org/) are impressing and we believe we’ll see the same in quantum.

We continue to work hard to support the development of a vibrant, open quantum technology ecosystem. Thanks to all of you who have joined us in this mission.

*   ****New from Unitary Fund****

*   Welcome [Dan Strano](https://github.com/WrathfulSpatula) and [Vincent Russo](https://vprusso.github.io/) to the Unitary Fund team! They’re working on a new (and so far un-announced) Unitary Labs project :)
*   About **Mitiq**: 

*   We released [versions](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/releases) 0.8.0 through 0.9.3 of Mitiq, adding many new collaborators from the community. Thanks for your contributions!
*   We implemented [Clifford Data Regression](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/cdr_api.html), a new error-mitigation technique \[[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01157)\] and further deployed probabilistic error cancellation in the code base.

*   We hosted [**unitaryHACK**](https://unitaryfund.github.io/unitaryhack/), our first decentralized hackathon with bounties on 19 open source quantum [projects](https://unitaryfund.github.io/unitaryhack/):

*   \>35 hackers; [64 contributions](https://unitaryfund.github.io/unitaryhack/results.html) in two weeks
*   50% of hackers new to Open Source, ~100% new to quantum open source
*   Special thanks to [Xanadu](https://xanadu.ai/), [PASQAL](https://pasqal.io/), and [DoraHacks](https://dorahacks.com/) for sponsoring extra bounties.

*   We reached almost 1,000 folks on the Unitary Fund [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/JqVGmpkP96) server
*   We’ve co-authored two new papers in quantum open source software: One on the new QuTiP’s features for pulse-level control of quantum circuits ([arXiv:2105.09902](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09902)) and one on Pulser, a new library to simulate Rydberg-atom quantum processors ([arXiv:2104.15044](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.15044)).
*   We hosted Loïc Henriet in our [Quantum Software Talks Series](https://unitary.fund/talks.html) where he spoke about [Pulser](https://github.com/pasqal-io/Pulser): an open source library for pulse simulation and design for neutral atoms
*   We spoke about Unitary Fund to many new communities! At [OneQuantum Africa summit](https://www.runtheworld.today/app/invitation/21920); [QuBites](https://www.valoremreply.com/post/qubites_2-4/); [Codestories](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/CodeStories/Quantum-Code-with-Dr-Sarah-Kaiser); [Diversity in Quantum computing by QubitxQubit](https://www.qubitbyqubit.org/conference); [Screaming in the cloud podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/inevitability-quantum-computing-dr-sarah-kaiser/id1361244178?i=1000507695620); [Portland Quantum Computing Meetup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF4d0Pr1zj0); [Galileo Galilei Institute's Summer School on Quantum Computing and Sensing](https://www.ggi.infn.it/showevent.pl?id=402)
*   We had some great digital swag for unitaryHACK and a [Mitiq logo](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq#mitiq) designed by [Frances Poblete](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francespoblete/)!  
      
    

*   ****6 New Grants****
