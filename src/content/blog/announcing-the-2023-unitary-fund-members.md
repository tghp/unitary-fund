Dear Unitary Fund community,

We're excited to share our Q2 2022 quarterly update and highlight some of what UF's been involved with so far this year.

We **launched [Metriq](https://unitary.fund/posts/metriq_release.html)**, the community-driven platform to benchmark quantum computing metrics. We partnered with IQT Labs, USRA, RIKEN, the SQMS quantum research center, Cambridge Quantum, Strangeworks, Agnostiq, Super.Tech, Quantonation, the Quantum Computing Report and more organizations. Add and review benchmarks at: https://metriq.info/
