Unitary Fund Q1 2021 Update: New grants and a Mitiq release driven by the community
===================================================================================

**Unitary Fund** is a non-profit working to create a quantum technology ecosystem that benefits the most people.

  

13 April, 2021

To the Unitary Fund community,

It's been an amazing year at [Unitary Fund](https://unitary.fund/) so far: we've grown our [microgrant program](https://unitary.fund/grants.html), launched a new [streaming talk series](https://unitary.fund/talks.html), and opened up a [Discord server](https://discord.unitary.fund/) for the community.

We continue to work hard to support the development of a vibrant, open quantum technology ecosystem. Thanks to all of you who have joined us in this mission.

*   ****New from Unitary Fund****

*   We are running [**UnitaryHack**](https://unitaryfund.github.io/unitaryhack/)**,** our first **quantum open source hackathon** with SWAG and BOUNTIES, on May 14-30th!
*   **Welcome [**Olivia**](https://twitter.com/unitaryfund/status/1379139956627501058)**!** Our newest team member, Olivia has joined as our new Administration to help us grow and optimize Unitary Fund 's programs.**
*   **Help wanted:** We are hiring for [technical staff positions](https://unitary.fund/jobs/mts.html). We’re not only interested in quantum experienced applicants, but also diverse applicants with full stack web experience.
*   If you missed it, read our [2020 **Annual Report**](https://unitary.fund/posts/2020.html) here.
*   About **Mitiq**: 

*   We continue to develop in the open, and now at its 0.7.0 [release](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html) on PyPI. You can join our community call on Fridays at 2:30pm ET on Discord ( [discord.unitary.fund](http://discord.unitary.fund/))
*   Mitiq v.0.7.0 contains several contributions from the community! Thanks to @yhindy for adding a method to parametrically scale noise in circuit, to @elmahmoud for adding a factory for zero noise extrapolation, to @aaron-robertson and @pchung39 for adding Qiskit executors with depolarizing noise to the utils, to @purva-thakre for several fixes and improvements. Thanks also to @BobinMathew and @marwahaha for typo corrections.
*   **We added [probabilistic error correction](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/guide-getting-started.html#probabilistic-error-cancellation) (PEC)** to the quantum error mitigation techniques. 
*   Everyone can now contribute examples to the documentation directly with Jupyter Notebooks thanks to a new MystNB-based infrastructure.

*   We had more guests on [**Quantum Software Talks Series**](https://unitary.fund/talks.html) on Twitch, with recordings uploaded to Youtube. 

*   We hosted Intro to [QuTiP](http://qutip.org/): A Quantum Toolbox in Python by Shahnawaz Ahmed and Intro to [QuNetSim](http://github.com/tqsd/QuNetSim): A Software Framework for Quantum Networks by Stephen DiAdamo.

*   We hosted 3 research talks on Discord:

*   “Exponential Error Suppression for Near-Term Quantum Devices”, by Bálint Koczor.
*   Chen Wang, “Protecting a bosonic qubit with autonomous quantum error correction”, by Chen Wang.
*   AMA on gate tomography and randomized benchmarking, by Cassandra Granade.

*   Sarah from the Unitary Fund team gave an [interview](https://www.lastweekinaws.com/podcast/screaming-in-the-cloud/the-inevitability-of-quantum-computing-with-dr.-sarah-kaiser/) on quantum computing 
*   [Andrea](http://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR21/Session/E33.5) and [Ryan](https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR21/Session/C33.2) spoke on our error-mitigating research at the APS March Meeting

*   ****7 New Grants****

*   To [Goutam Tamvada](https://github.com/xvzcf) and [Douglas Stebila](https://www.douglas.stebila.ca/) to develop VeriFrodo, an open-source package implementing a lattice-based quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms in Jasmin within the [Open Quantum Safe](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe) project.
*   To [Owen Lockwood](https://github.com/lockwo) to develop a software package using classical deep reinforcement learning to improve quantum optimization, both for quantum simulations and hardware integration.
*   To [Daniel Stilck França](https://twitter.com/dsfranca) to develop a software package that will help benchmark the limitations of noisy quantum devices for solving optimization problems. \[[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05532.pdf)\] \[ [QIP talk on the technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00ULKjGu1-A)\].
*   To [Rhea Parekh](https://twitter.com/RheaParekh1) and [Stephen DiAdamo](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=k9O1vSwAAAAJ&hl=en) to further develop [Interlin-q](https://github.com/Interlin-q/Interlin-q/), a distributed quantum-enabled simulator integrated with QuNetSim.
*   To [Dariusz Lasecki](https://dlasecki.github.io/) to build an open-source Python library that delivers easy-to-use high-quality pre-trained machine learning models to predict good QAOA starting parameters for selected classes of problems.
*   To Oscar Higgot, to continue developing and maintaining [PyMatching](https://github.com/oscarhiggott/PyMatching), a Python package for decoding quantum error correcting codes with minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM).
*   To Nicola Mosco, to develop [HomodyneCT](https://gitlab.com/homodyne-ct/hct-tools), a software package for medical diagnostics that uses a quantum-tomography-inspired technique for state reconstruction in order to reduce the radiation dose patients receive.

*   ****News from UF Projects****
