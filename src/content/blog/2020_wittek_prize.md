Over the past six months, we have collaborated with the Quantum Open Source Foundation (QOSF) to help them design, roll-out and award the 2020 Wittek quantum prize to an individual making, with their work, exceptional contributions to the quantum open-source software ecosystem. We are glad to share the [announcement](https://medium.com/qosf/announcing-the-winner-of-the-2020-wittek-quantum-prize-for-open-source-software-59e847b38d9b) of the 2020 Wittek quantum prize, which is awarded to Roger Luo.  

A video inteview can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-S2RfWoTr4). Roger will also be interviewed live on 11 February, 2021, at 9am PST/12pm EST, on Unitary Fund's [Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/unitaryfund), tune in to ask questions in the chat.  

We'd like to thank the Unitary Fund Advisory Board, which has been volunteering time to review nominations, together with the Tech Team, from an exceptional pool of candidates. This prize acknowledges the importance of the impact that individuals can have on the open-source ecosystem, for the benefit of the whole quantum science community.
