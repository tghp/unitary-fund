 Hear what our community members had to say about unitaryHACK!
 
 From **Alberto Maldonado**, maintainer from the Quantum Universal
Education project,

\"UnitaryHack is an event where you can demonstrate your skills and
abilities, while helping and make an impression on the quantum
community.\"

**Maria Gragera Garces**, first-time contributor to the Quantum
Universal Education project with a bounty and also to Qiskit, said that

"UnitaryHACK was a great place to learn and network with members in the
quantum community. It was an amazing experience for me! And helped me
push some of my first contributions into the quantum open source
ecosystem! Thank you unitaryHACK ‚ù§Ô∏è"

**Gregory Vargese**, aka \@WingCode, the participant with most hacks:
**8 bounties completed**. In the wrap-up party on [**Unitary Fund's
Discord**](http://discord.unitary.fund/), all the three of them
were featured in the community call, together with maintainers from
**PyQIR**, **QuTiP**, **Qiskit**, **Mitiq**, **Qrack**, **Toqito** and
many participants.

**Janne Kotilahti**, maintainer of KQCircuits at IQM, said that "it was
great to get the first non-IQM contributions to KQCircuits. Looking
forward to next year\'s unitaryhack!"

For **Luciano Bello**, maintainer of Qiskit at IBM, "Qiskit is a better
project after unitaryHACK"
