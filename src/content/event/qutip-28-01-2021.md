## About the talk
    
[QuTiP](http://qutip.org/): A quantum toolbox in Python, is one of the most popular tools to simulate open quantum systems – but it has expanded beyond that over the years. It is a simple but powerful library that, used by students, researchers, engineers, is having a tremendous impact on quantum science research. QuTiP is also Unitary Fund’s first affiliated project. In this talk, I will introduce the library and take the example of some new developments in QuTiP to show the ease with which one can simulate open quantum systems as well as contribute to the development of such open-source software tools to promote reproducibility and therefore accelerate the adoption of a particular simulation technique across the research community.
