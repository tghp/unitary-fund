## About the talk
    
[QuNetSim](http://github.com/tqsd/QuNetSim) is a quantum-enabled network simulator that adds common quantum networking tasks like teleportation, superdense coding, sharing EPR pairs, etc, to aid in the develop of quantum networking protocols. With QuNetSim, one can design and test robust quantum network protocols under various network conditions. In this presentation I will give an overview of what QuNetSim does and demonstrate some examples of how it can be used.
    
      
## About the speaker
    
**Stephen DiAdamo** is an electrical engineering PhD student from TU Munich. After completing his bachelor's in computer science from the University of Toronto, he moved to Munich, Germany to complete a mathematics master's degree at TU Munich and continued after as a PhD student. His research involves applications of entanglement in quantum networks as well as quantum simulation development.
