## About the talk

Random numbers are everywhere. Computer algorithms, data encryption, physical simulations, and even the arts use them all the time. There is one problem though: it turns out that they are actually very difficult to produce in large amounts. Luckily, the probabilistic nature of quantum computers makes these devices particularly useful for the task. QRAND introduces a versatile interface layer between NumPy and several quantum computing platforms (qiskit, cirq, qsharp...), along with some useful functionality that enables the production of quantum random numbers (QRN) according to different quantum protocols, and for a wide variety of probability distributions.
