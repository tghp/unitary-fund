## About the talk

[Verifrodo](https://github.com/xvzcf/VeriFrodo) is an open-source package implementing a lattice-based quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms in Jasmin within the Open Quantum Safe project. This talk will provide an overview of post-quantum cryptography and its use in internet protocols and software applications, as well as place our Unitary Fund project, VeriFrodo, in this context.

  
## About the speaker

**Goutam Tamvada** has a Bachelor of Applied Science in Computer Engineering from the University of Waterloo, and has been working on open source software for the Open Quantum Safe project for the past 2 years.
