## About the talk
    
The manipulation of neutral atoms by light is at the heart of countless scientific discoveries in the field of quantum physics in the last three decades. The level of control that has been achieved at the single particle level within arrays of optical traps, while preserving the fundamental properties of quantum matter (coherence, entanglement, superposition), makes these technologies prime candidates to implement disruptive computation paradigms. In this talk, I will present [pulser](https://github.com/pasqal-io/Pulser), a recently developed open-source python framework enabling practitioners to control those devices at the pulse level.
    
      
## About the speaker
    
**Loïc Henriet** holds an engineering degree and a PhD in theoretical physics from Ecole Polytechnique, in France. He subsequently worked as a researcher at the Institute for Photonic Sciences (ICFO) in Barcelona, Spain. His research interests lied in the description of collective effects in light-matter systems. In June 2019, he joined Pasqal, a Paris-based quantum computing startup manufacturing quantum processors powered by arrays of single atoms. Since then, he has been heading the quantum software developments.
